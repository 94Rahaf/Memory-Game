#### Udacity's Google Developer Challenger Scholarship - Front End Web Development

### Project goal
This project aims to test each student's ability to implement basic vanilla Javascript knowledge (OOJS is not yet contemplated in this project) by using ready-made static, non-interactive html/css files and coding a fully interactive memory game app.  

#### Project specifications
###### Game behavior
  - **Memory Game Logic** > The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
  - **Congratulations Popup** > When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
  - **Restart Button** > A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
  - **Star Rating** > The game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display at least 3 stars. After *some* number of moves, it should change to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a even lower star rating (down to 1).
  - **Timer** > When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
  - **Move Counter** > Game displays the current number of moves a user has made. The number of moves needed to change the rating is up to you, but it should happen at *some* point.

###### Interface Design
- **Styling** > Application uses CSS to style components for the game.
- **Usability** > All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

###### Documentation
- **README** > A README file is included detailing the game and all dependencies.
- **Comments** > Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary.
- **Code Quality** > Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the [Udacity JavaScript Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html).

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| Github | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud
